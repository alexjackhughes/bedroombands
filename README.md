# Introduction

_The purpose of this app is to create a template_
_project that uses Facebook's Create-React-App project as the frontend,_
_and a Node/Express API as the backend, with a MongoDB database._


## Getting Started

You can run the backend and the frontend of the application from the console using:

```
cd server
```

```
npm run dev
```

The **Frontend React App** will be running on:
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/ "http://localhost:3000/")

The **Backend API** will be running on:
[localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/ "http://localhost:5000/")


## Deployment

_First, make sure git is set-up with Heroku, and branch is up-to-date_

```
git push heroku master
```
