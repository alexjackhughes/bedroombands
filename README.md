# BedroomBands

![alt text](https://www.bedroombands.com/bedroombands-landing.png)

_There are so many good musicians out there, all writing and recording in their bedrooms. If you're here, you're probably one of them._

_We want to use technology to unite bedroom musicians, and to make possible international collaborations that would have been impossible even 10 years ago. We want to help create bedroom bands with members all over the world!_

_BedroomBands is a community project written in React and Node._
